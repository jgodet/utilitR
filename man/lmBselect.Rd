\title{Variable selection and fitting Linear Models using bayesian inference.}
\usage{
lmBselect(
  formula,
  data,
  graphOutput = TRUE,
  nIter = 10000,
  thin = 1,
  effect = "random"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{an object of class "formula" (or one that can be coerced to that class): a symbolic description of the model to be fitted.}

\item{data}{an optional data frame containing the variables in the model. If not found in data, the variables are taken from environment(formula), typically the environment from which blm is called.}

\item{graphOutput}{regression parameters graphical output (MCMC Trace and posterior density)}

\item{nIter}{number of iterations}

\item{thin}{thinning interval for monitors}

\item{effect}{"fixed", "random" or "randomPrior" effect for variable selection}
}
\value{
regression parameters
}
\description{
Variable selection and fitting Linear Models using bayesian inference.
}
\details{
Models for lm are specified symbolically. A typical model has the form response ~ terms where response is the (numeric) response vector and terms is a series of terms which specifies a linear predictor for response.    The effect "randomPrior" adds a beta prior for the model inclusion probability. This induces a distribution for the number of included variables which has longer tails than the binomial distribution, allowing the model to learn about the degree of sparsity.

\examples{
#generate model data.
n <- 500
p <- 20
X <- matrix(rnorm(n*p),ncol=p)
beta <- 2^(0:(1-p))
print(beta)
alpha <- 3
tau <- 2
eps <- rnorm(n,0,1/sqrt(tau))
y <- alpha+as.vector(X\%*\%beta + eps)
daten <- cbind(y,as.data.frame(X))

mod <- lm(y~.,data=daten)
require(MASS)
stepAIC(mod,direction = "both")
lmBselect(y~.,data=daten,nIter=10000,graphOutput=FALSE,effect="randomPrior")
